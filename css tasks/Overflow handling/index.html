        if it does not fit inside the fixed box. It will continue outside the border and will not be cut or 
        hidden. This helps to see how the content behaves when there is no control over overflowing text. </p>

        inside the box will simply be hidden. You will not see scrollbars and the hidden part cannot be viewed. This is a long text used to check the overflow auto property. Scrollbars will appear only if the 
        content is bigger than the box. If the content fits, no scrollbars are shown. This is a long text used to check the overflow auto property. Scrollbars will appear only if the
